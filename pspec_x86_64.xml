        <Summary xml:lang="en">A *Nix friendly Quake Engine based on the SDL port of the popular FitzQuake</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="en">QuakeSpasm is a modern, cross-platform Quake engine based on FitzQuake
It includes support for 64 bit CPUs and custom music playback, a new
sound driver, some graphical niceities, and numerous bug-fixes and other
improvements.
Quakespasm utilizes either the SDL or SDL2 frameworks, so choose which
one works best for you. SDL is probably less buggy, but SDL2 has nicer
features and smoother mouse input - though no CD support.
Game data must be placed in ~/.quakespasm/id1.
